		When it comes to love, Aquarius is a funny creature. You’re an idealist who believes in true love, and 
		you’re always searching for a best friend and soulmate in one. On the other hand, your sign rules casual 
		connections, and you guard your independence fiercely.

	<p class="personality">
		&emsp; &emsp; The man who carries the pitcher of water is the symbol for this sign. This is because 
		Aquarians are often generous with their time and resources. For this reason this sign often find
		themselves in occupations where they are helping on some humanitarian level. They are interested and
		have a deep concern for the welfare of others. They never know a stranger and are generally loved by 
		all around them. Aquarians never meet a stranger and often will go out of their way to meet with people 
		that they’ve not heard from for years.
	</p>
	<p class="upside">
		&emsp;  Aquarians are among the friendliest of the signs, making friends everywhere. They are often chosen 
		among co-workers and family for special awards and honors because of their ability to network. Highly
		intelligent they are energetic and talented, often using their abilities to help others. Despite their
		extensive people skills, they often crave alone time to reflect and think about things. </p>

	<p class="downside">
		&emsp;If this sign does not have alone time and time to do much desired reflection, they become dour, 
		emotionless, and even are prone to depressive interludes. They can become highly resentful if they believe
		that their voice is not being truly heard or valued. Because they do self-reflect, this sign can become quite 
		eccentric in some of the hobbies that they pursue, or activities they enjoy. </p>
