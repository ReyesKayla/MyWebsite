		You’re a romantic sign, Pisces, and you love to be in love—at least, in theory. Ruled by Neptune, 
		planet of fantasy, you want to be swept away by romance. Glamorous Pisces rules the imagination,
		and you have a way of making everything feel tinged with magic and fantasy. You’re gentle,
		nurturing and sensitive, and your mates rely on you to soften the rough edges.

	<p class="personality">
		&emsp; &emsp; The fish is the symbol given to this sign, primarily because fish live in a secretive 
		and mysterious place. Pisces tend to be daydreamers, often dreaming up brilliant ideas and plans which 
		they are unable to facilitate themselves. They have a happy and vibrant inner life that few get to share 
		or see. They are deeply caring about others and don’t like to see people become unhappy.
	</p>
	<p class="upside">
		&emsp; Pisces are empathetic people, often feeling badly for someone whose life is not going well. They
		feel the need to reach out to those who are less fortunate and will often find themselves involved in drama 
		that they hadn’t intended. They are kind, caring individuals who feel everything deeply, even though you
		would not know it on the surface.  </p>
	</div>
	<p class="downside">
		&emsp; Because they feel everything so intensely, this sign can often become a clinical worrier. They will 
		worry that they are not worrying. This tendency to worry also leads to indecision on their part, fearing that
		if they make a decision that others disagree with that they will have upset someone. Pisces don’t like to
		hurt people’s feelings and as such become conflicted when they have to make decisions. They do not do well
		as leaders, but are impressive support personnel. </p>
