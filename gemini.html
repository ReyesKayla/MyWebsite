		Love: It ain’t easy for an ever-changing Gemini. As the sign of the Twins, you have so many sides to 
		your personality, it’s hard to find one person who’s compatible with them all. You need a soulmate who 
		is also your playmate. For you the fun, flirty stuff IS “serious.” Only a few special people understand 
		that — and these are the ones you should go after.

	<p class="personality">
		&emsp; &emsp; The Gemini symbol is that of a pair of twins. This is because this sign rarely likes 
		to do anything alone. Gemini are never happier than when they are sharing ideas and concepts with 
		someone else. Communication is a key element for this sign, so many of this sign go into occupations 
		that include some communication in some large capacity. Curiosity is a key characteristic of this sign, 
		and they are people persons. Gemini are great at parties because they can find almost anything to talk
		about with anyone. Gemini are adventurous by nature and so engage in traveling as often as they can as
		it affords them the opportunity to meet new people, experience new ideas, and to learn new concepts.

	<p class="upside">
		&emsp;  Gemini are great conversationalists, and are charming people. Interesting to speak with, Gemini 
		know a little bit about a lot of things. They have a great sense of humor and are generally optimistic people. 
		Gemini often make their own fun, despising boredom. </p>
	</div>
	<p class="downside">
		&emsp; Gemini like to be the center of attention; always. When they perceive the situation to not be in their 
		favor, they leave it. This can include relationships, careers, and friendships. Because of this need to be 
		seen as important, Gemini will sometimes stretch the truth. When they are focused only on themselves they can 
		be largely unsympathetic and rude. Male Gemini tend to change jobs often, and female Gemini change partners often 
		due to boredom. </p>
