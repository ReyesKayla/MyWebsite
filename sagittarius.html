		In love, Sagittarius is full of contradictions. Symbolized by the centaur, the mythical half-horse/half-human,
		you’re governed by both animal instincts and enlightened thinking. Sagittarius rules morals, wisdom, higher 
		education…along with the hips and thighs. Although you’re always striving for divine inspiration, you’ve got
		a serious lust for life’s “earthly pleasures.”

	<p class="personality">
		&emsp; &emsp; The centaur is the symbol for this sign. In mythology, the centaur was half man and half horse, 
		given to pursing pleasure. The centaur is shown with a bow, which he shoots. Wherever the arrow lands, the 
		centaur follows, retrieves the arrow and shoots again. Those born under this sign will love travelling, 
		discovering new things, meeting new people, and learning new things. Sagittarians crave the freedom of the 
		open road, both metaphorically and physically. They are most unhappy when they are tied to a normal routine 
		and can become restless in situations where there is not enough variety involved. 
	</p>
	<p class="upside">
		&emsp; Sagittarians are highly intelligent and love to be around intelligent people. They enjoy learning
		new things, traveling to new places, and experiencing unique adventures. Creativity is at the core of who 
		they are and Sagittarians are often creating and recreating their living situations, work situations, and 
		human relationships.  </p>
	</div>
	<p class="downside">
		&emsp; Confining a Sagittarian and not allowing for ample space to roam will make this sign rude, and 
		uncooperative. Sagittarians often come up with unrealistic, big plans, but lack the ability to follow 
		through with them. This isn’t because they aren’t capable, but rather they can become sidetracked chasing 
		another avenue of adventure or thought. Sagittarians are about the bigger picture and details often bog 
		them down and bore them. </p>
