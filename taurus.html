		Taurus is an old-fashioned type when it comes to love, a complex combo of toughness and sensitivity.
		To the outside world, you may appear completely composed, but inside, you’re a hopeless romantic 
		looking for that “love of a lifetime.” Your needs are basic: you want a stable, loyal partner who’s 
		affectionate and classy.

	<p class="personality">
		&emsp; &emsp; Tarus’s symbol is the bull because this sign’s characteristic is to be peaceful and 
		methodical. This sign is often very deliberate in their actions, relaxed, and enjoys all of the
		sensual pleasures that abound in this dimension. Food, drink, sex, luxury, are all sought after by
		the typical taruean. Because this sign loves luxury they are willing to work hard to obtain it. They
		are slow to anger, but once disturbed it can be volatile. Taurus signs look for stability in their 
		lives and in their partners and co-workers. Taurus people are not in a hurry, typically, and it can 
		take them many years to decide what it is that they would like to do for a living, or where they’d
		like to go on vacation
	</p>
	<p class="upside">
		&emsp; Taurus people almost always finish what they start. They are deliberate thinkers and when 
		making decisions usually make the right one. Taurus are generally adaptable, adjusting easily to 
		new circumstances especially if there is the reward of luxury, comfort, or sensual reward. This sign 
		loves to laugh and spend time with family. </p>
	</div>
	<p class="downside">
		&emsp; Taurus can be stubborn and ‘bullish’ about ideas that they’ve adopted, which can also make them 
		difficult to get along with when attempting to cooperate on a shared project. Taurus needs to be the 
		leader and to be held in high esteem. If they are not, they refuse to work, often finding small ways to
		sabotage projects, relationships, or undermine authority that they deem unworthy of leadership. </p>
