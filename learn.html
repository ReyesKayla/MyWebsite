		<p class="one"> WHAT IS ASTROLOGY? </p>
		<p class="two">
			&nbsp; &nbsp; The roots of astrology go back to the dawn of man himself but even as far as 3000 years ago 
			the great Hindu sage Parasara expounded the principles of sidereal astrology also known as Vedic
			astrology. His monumental work Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra is a classic work and basic reading
			for any astrologer who wishes to pursue this branch of study. Around the same time in Mesopotamia
			the Chaldeans built some of the earliest “observatories” called Ziggurats which were like watchtowers
			used for stargazing. Some of these were up to 300 feet in height. And it was the Chaldeans who sliced 
			up the celestial sphere into the 12 star signs as we have come to know them.
			<br>
			<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp; Initially both astronomy and astrology were one and the same with observations that there was some sort 
			of synchronicity between the planetary and stellar movements with events here on planet Earth leading
			astrology to become deeply aligned with the art of divination, forecasting and other sorts of
			prognostication. On the other side of the Earth, the Mayans had developed an incredibly sophisticated 
			system of observing and connecting the planets and in particular Venus to the events locally. They had 
			even forecast highly accurate calendars and these are almost as accurate as any produced today by modern 
			astronomers.

		<p class="one"> THE ZODIACS </p>
		<p class="two">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;The word Zodiac literally means animals and refers to the patterns or configurations of creatures as seen 
			in the twinkling stars at night. The Zodiac belt is the great circle around which our luminescent Sun apparently
			moves month by month throughout the year, modulating the energy of those different constellational signs and 
			thereby transmitting the celestial radiations to our Earth.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;The mystery of the impact of the zodiac and astrology on humankind can’t be easily explained scientifically, 
			although we can all observe the synchronicity of life and its cycle here on earth with those planetary movements, 
			in the same way the ancients did thousands of years ago when they witnessed that certain planetary and stellar

		<p class="one"> THE ELEMENTS </p>
		<p class="two"> 
			The elements are the following: <br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b class="fire"> Fire Signs </b>
			<br>
			<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three fire signs – <b class="fire"> Aries, Leo and Sagittarius</b>. Fire signs give fire, give action, light, and radiance. 
				They are; therefore related to the qualities of enthusiasm and zeal, love, passion, courage, speed, enterprise, 
				individuality and spirituality. Note that this triplicity has its beginning in the cardinal sign Aries which is 
				the first sign, which rules the east or sunrise or the beginning of self. The note that is struck in the beginning 
				of a triplicity is the ruling note of that group of signs, hence the ruling note of the fire Triplicity is SELF.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b class="earth"> Earth Signs </b>
			<br>
			<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;To a man, the earth is the acme of solidity, in both a figurative and literal sense the ground under his feet. 
				the earth signs<b class="earth">  Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn</b> produce a being who believes in solidity, in palpable reality and in 
				aims which are practically attainable. And as it is certain that we cannot get rid of matter except by controlling
				it, it is necessary that the element of the earth should be represented in the Zodiac. There is, however, an ascending 
				line in these three earthy signs beginning with the fixed sign, which is typically earthy.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b class="air"> Air Signs </b>
			<br>
			<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;The element air symbolises man’s thoughts, his mental power. It is the positive power which raises him above the animal,
				and it is noticeable that not one of the airy signs has an animal as a symbol. The air is the element most “apart from 
				the earth” and thus people under this influence have the least inclination to earthly things. Usually, the airy signs show
				an extraordinary disdain of earthly logic, and this is in some degree proved by<b class="air"> Gemini</b>, but chiefly by<b class="air"> Aquarius and Libra. </b>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b class="water"> Water Signs </b>
			<br>
			<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;The element water is the negative, female principle and symbolises feelings, emotions, therefore in the three signs which are <b class="water"> Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces</b> forming 
				this triangle, the element of feeling is prominent. “The sea is always full and spreads its waters on all sides. (Zohar)-and 
				the watery signs are particularly sensitive to the sea of emotions in which they live, and readily contact others along the <br>
				line oI feeling.
