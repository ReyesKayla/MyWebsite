		Romance-a-holics by nature, Leo loves being in love—and your proud, flamboyant sign wants the whole 
		world to know when you are. Plain and simple, Leos love drama — in fact, your sign rules it. Unless 
		there ‘s romance and fireworks that light up the sky, you want no part of the relationship. Red roses, 
		poetry, expensive gifts…you’ll take it all. Spoiling and being spoiled are the name of the game.

	<p class="personality">
		&emsp; &emsp;The lion is the symbol for this sign because the lion embodies the best characteristics 
		of the leo; proud, regal, relaxed, and in charge. Leo people know they are in charge, even when it
		may seem outwardly that they are not. Leo signs tend to like relaxation, preferably someplace warm and
		comfortable. Leo likes the big picture, not the small details and fine print. Things that are too 
		complicated, involved, or boring, they have no patience for. They are natural leaders and don’t often
		do well in situations where they have to take orders from others.
	</p>
	<p class="upside">
		&emsp;  Leo tend to be honest and decent people, opting to do the right thing regardless of the situation. 
		They love organization so that they can find their ‘things’. Leos love material goods and luxury and want 
		those that they love to experience this wealth as well. Leo are generally accepting of everyone initially 
		and make decent, lasting relationships. </p>
	</div>
	<p class="downside">
		&emsp; Leo have a great sense of self-worth which can cross the line into arrogance. Leo can tend toward 
		extravagance if they are not satisfied with what they have. Because they like to be in charge, they can 
		often become smothering to their mates and friends, which may leave them alone (which Leo hates). Divorce
		and loss are devastating to this sign as they are all about the community and family. </p>
